Opposing the red brick of the house is native white sandstone, fluted porch columns, and patterned masonry chimneys.</p>
<p>
	The home was built by a Bradford, PA contractor, J.A. Olds at a cost of $6,000 â€“ considered extravagant for its time. The interior of the mansion boasted golden oak and leather decoration as well as intricate wallpapering and cut glass windows.</p>
<p>
	The Bouton Home was one of the most modern residences of its day in Smethport, meriting newspaper coverage of the grand opening.</p>
